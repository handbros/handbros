# Hi, there! :wave:

I am a versatilist and easily adapt to different hats (:computer:Desktop App Developer, :iphone: Mobile App Developer, :globe_with_meridians: Full Stack Web Developer, :brain:ML Engineer) depending on what the project requires. I love exploring new tech stack and leveraging them to build cool stuffs.
